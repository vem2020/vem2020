                        Mining software repositories (MSR) has matured as an important research field. The body of
                        knowledge provided by empirical work on MSR is becoming increasingly important to support a
                        wide range of software engineering tasks. In this talk, we provide a personal reflection on the
                        attempt to organize a research group around this theme. As expected, we will show some results,
                        but also raise possible perils that may hinder long-term impact of the group.

                  <tbody>
                    <tr>

                        Software licenses govern the way software can be used and above all re-distributed, and range
                        across different levels of restriction, i.e., from very restrictive licenses such as Affero-GPL
                        towards permissive ones like Apache or BSD. The recent history of software projects is
                        permeated of cases in which a suitable (or unsuitable) decision about software licenses played
                        a major role in the success of a project.

                        Starting from recent literature and from problems actually encountered by developers, this talk
                        conjectures how legal and technical expertise need to be properly combined when developing and
                        evolving software projects. This has noticeable implications for practitioners, which require
                        to cope with factors they often neglect when choosing components, but also for educators,
                        responsible of introducing software licenses in computer science curricula, and, last but not
                        least, for researchers, which might make developers' life easier through the development of
                        licensing-aware recommender systems.
