<h1>Workshop Motivation</h1>
<p>The growing need for maintaining and evolving software systems is a major challenge in modern software engineering. Several studies have shown that maintenance tasks are responsible for a substantial cost in the software development process, sometimes reaching 90% of the total cost. The pressure for faster development and releases of new software versions has also increased the interest in software evolution and maintenance throughout the years. Besides, there is an increasing investment in these activities since the advent of execution environments (e.g., Web computing, ubiquitous computing, and cloud computing), development paradigms (e.g., Feature-Oriented Programming, Service-Oriented Architecture, DevOps) and new types of media (e.g., mobile devices, gesture-based interfaces etc.).</p>
<p>In order to perform maintenance and evolution tasks in complex software systems, developers must resort to advanced means for understanding the software artifacts to be modified. Software comprehension, however, is a non-trivial task. In this scenario, software visualization becomes an interesting resource, relying on the use of visual abstractions to facilitate comprehension of software systems under several viewpoints, representing structural, behavioral, and time-based aspects of software. The clear intersection between Software Visualization, Software Evolution, and Software Maintenance led to the creation of an event where researchers can discuss challenges in these fields and work together to overcome them.</p>    
<p>The Fifth Workshop on Software Visualization, Maintenance, and Evolution (VEM 2020) aims at bringing together the research communities interested in topics related to Software Visualization, Software Evolution, and Software Maintenance to share and discuss ideas, reflecting on alternatives to perform visualization, evolution, and maintenance of software systems. VEM is also a great opportunity for strengthening research group collaborations, as well as identifying new research opportunities. VEM is co-located with the 9th Brazilian Conference on Software: Theory and Practice (CBSoft 2020).</p>

<a name="submission"></a>
<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
<p>The VEM workshop accepts technical papers (up to 8 pages) written in English or in Portuguese. All papers must be submitted in PDF format and formatted according to the SBC template
(available at <a href="/vem2020/paper_template/template_sbc.rar">http://vem2020.github.io/vem2020/paper_template/template_sbc.rar</a>).</p>
<p>Submitted papers must be unpublished and should not be under review elsewhere. Experimental evaluation of the results is desirable, but it is not a precondition to submit a paper to the workshop. Papers with innovative and promising proposals are welcome. The acceptance of a paper implies that at least one of its authors will register for the workshop and present the paper. The workshop proceedings will be published online available from CBSoft 2020 page.
<p>Papers should be submitted electronically through JEMS at</p>
<p><a href="https://jems.sbc.org.br/cbsoft2020_vem ">https://jems.sbc.org.br/cbsoft2020_vem </a></p>

<a name="blinded"></a>
<h2>Double-Blind Submission</h2>

<p>VEM 2020 will follow a double-blind review process.</p>

<h4>How to prepare the blinded manuscript</h4>

<p>First, both author names and affiliations must be omitted from the manuscript. Besides, there are other rules that have to be considered to ensure the manuscript is correctly prepared for double-blind review:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Uses the third person to refer to your own related work.</li>
    <li>You should anonymize the reference to your previous work in the submitted manuscript. For example, cite papers published by the authors in the manuscript as follows: "based on the previous work [Anonymous 2020]".</li>
    <li>The reference list should be presented as: "Anonymous (2020) Details omitted for double-blind reviewing".</li>
    <li>You should not relying on supplementary material. However, whether you need to make available any artifact, please anonymize it and the respective website.</li>
</ul>

<p>In case you have any doubt about the preparation of your manuscript following the double-blind rules, do not hesitate to send an email to cbsoft.vem2020@gmail.com.</p>
